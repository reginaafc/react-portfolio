          <p className="card-text">
            Regardless of laws against animal abuse in MÃ©xico, Mexico ranks
            first in animals that have been abandoned to live in the streets,
            condemned to despair, suffering and hunger. Most of these animals
            came to the streets due to carelessness and negligence. Many
            unsterilized pups are abandoned. If they survive, in many cases they
            reproduce, giving birth to another generation of puppies relegated
            to living abroad. With this in mind, we decided to create Pawbook,
            to help this animals find a home.
